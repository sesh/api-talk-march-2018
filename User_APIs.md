- Talk to them
- Create user personas
- Write user-focussed stories
- Steal from agile

## Your API team needs a great tech lead, a great BA, and a great UX person

---

# #2: Build what they want

---

- Give them the data they need
- Make it easy to use
- Consistency is key

---

# #3: Document and test it

---

- An API is nothing without documentation
- You should have test coverage for everything
- Unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests, are all great
- Don't forget monitoring

---

# #4: Follow standards

---

- Use status codes and headers
- Tell the user what the did wrong
- TODO: RFC SPAM

---

# #5: Release, iterate and release

---

- Your users will change, so should your API
- Communicate features and ask for feedback
- Don't be afraid to release new versions
