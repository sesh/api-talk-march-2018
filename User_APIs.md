# 5 simple tips to get you going

---

## #1: Understand your consumers

---

- Find ways to talk to your users
- Write user-focussed stories
- Think about the tasks they are doing

---

## #2: Build what they want

---

- Give them the data they need as quickly as possible
- Consistency is key
- Discoverability of new features is important

---

## #3: Document and test it

---

- An API is nothing without documentation
- Unit tests, integration tests & smoke tests, are great but think about _user testing_ too!

---

## #4: Follow standards

---

- Use status codes and headers
- Tell the user what they did wrong
- Standard authenication methods
- Return valid responses
- Choose a style guide

---

## #5: Release, iterate and release

---

- Your users will change, so should your API
- Communicate features and ask for feedback
- Don't be afraid to release new versions

---

- Understand your consumers
- Build what they want
- Document and test it
- Follow standards
- Release, iterate and release
